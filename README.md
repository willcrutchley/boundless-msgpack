This script converts .msgpack files to .json files and visa versa, so long as they are from Boundless!

Usage: 
This requires python3 and the pip module 'msgpack-python'. You can install this by running 'python3 -m pip install msgpack' from the command line.
 
With python3 and msgpack-python installed, place all the msgpack files you want to convert in the 'msgpack' folder, and the script will output to the 'converted' folder. Just double click the msgpack_to_json.py file, or from command line do `python3 [path_to_script.py]`, then watch the magic happen!

The msgpack_to_json.py script will take files from the msgpack folder, and convert them to .json files in the converted folder.
The json_to_msgpack.py script will take files from the converted folder, and convert them to .msgpack files in the msgpack_reconverted folder. These new msgpack files can be used with the game, for all your tinkering needs!

Cheers!
